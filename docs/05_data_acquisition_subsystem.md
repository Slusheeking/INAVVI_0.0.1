## 3. Key Components

### 3.1 Data Pipeline Scheduler

The Data Pipeline Scheduler orchestrates the collection, validation, and processing of market data at regular intervals. It ensures that the system has access to up-to-date, validated data for making trading decisions.

#### 3.1.1 DataPipelineScheduler Class

The core component of the scheduler is the `DataPipelineScheduler` class, which:
- Initializes the data pipeline and related components
- Sets up the schedule for various data collection jobs
- Runs the scheduler loop
- Handles job execution and error handling

#### 3.1.2 Scheduled Jobs

The scheduler manages several types of jobs:

1. **Dynamic Ticker Selection Job**: Selects the most promising tickers from a large universe based on opportunity scores
2. **Position Sizing Job**: Calculates position sizes for selected tickers
3. **Price Data Collection Job**: Collects OHLCV data for selected tickers
4. **Quotes Data Collection Job**: Collects bid/ask quotes data
5. **Trades Data Collection Job**: Collects individual trades data
6. **Options Data Collection Job**: Collects options flow data
7. **Indicators Calculation Job**: Calculates technical indicators
8. **Full Pipeline Job**: Runs the complete data pipeline

#### 3.1.3 Scheduling Strategy

The scheduler employs a time-based scheduling strategy with different frequencies for different job types:

```mermaid

    Options Data Collection     :o2, 11:15, 1m
    Options Data Collection     :o3, 13:15, 1m
    Options Data Collection     :o4, 15:15, 1m
    
    section Every 4 Hours
    Indicators Calculation      :i1, 09:30, 1m
    Indicators Calculation      :i2, 13:30, 1m
    
    section Market Close
    Full Pipeline               :milestone, m3, 16:30, 0m
```

Key scheduling decisions:

1. **Dynamic Ticker Selection**: Runs once at market open (9:35 AM) to select the most promising tickers for the day
2. **Position Sizing**: Runs shortly after market open (9:45 AM) to calculate position sizes for selected tickers
3. **Price Data Collection**: Runs hourly to collect OHLCV data
4. **Quotes Data Collection**: Runs every 15 minutes to collect bid/ask quotes
5. **Trades Data Collection**: Runs every 30 minutes to collect trades data
6. **Options Data Collection**: Runs every 2 hours to collect options flow data
7. **Indicators Calculation**: Runs every 4 hours to calculate technical indicators
8. **Full Pipeline**: Runs once after market close (4:30 PM) to ensure all data is collected and processed

### 3.2 Data Validation Framework

The Data Validation Framework ensures data quality, consistency, and integrity across all components. It provides a comprehensive set of validation rules, cross-timeframe consistency checks, and market microstructure validation.

#### 3.2.1 DataValidator Class

The `DataValidator` class is the core component responsible for validating market data. It provides methods for validating different types of data, including OHLCV, quotes, trades, options flow, and derived features.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class DataValidator {
        +strict_mode: bool
        +validation_stats: Dict
        +warned_symbols: Set
        +volatility_regimes: Dict
        +market_hours_status: Dict
        +validate_ohlcv(symbol, timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume, source, timeframe)
        +validate_quote(symbol, timestamp, bid_price, bid_size, ask_price, ask_size, exchange, conditions, quote_id, source)
        +validate_trade(symbol, timestamp, price, size, exchange, conditions, trade_id, source)
        +validate_options_flow(symbol, timestamp, expiration_date, strike_price, option_type, contract_symbol, premium, volume, open_interest, implied_volatility, underlying_price, source)
        +validate_feature_data(feature_name, symbol, timestamp, value, tags)
        +validate_volume_weighted_price_pressure(symbol, timestamp, vwpp, reference_price)
        +validate_relative_strength(symbol, timestamp, relative_strength)
        +validate_price_change(symbol, previous_price, current_price)
        +validate_cross_timeframe_consistency(symbol, timeframes, data_by_timeframe)
        +validate_order_book_imbalance(symbol, timestamp, bid_sizes, ask_sizes, bid_prices, ask_prices)
        +validate_trade_flow_imbalance(symbol, timestamp, buy_volume, sell_volume)
        +set_volatility_regime(symbol, volatility_regime)
        +set_market_hours_status(symbol, is_market_hours)
        +get_validation_stats()
        +reset_validation_stats()
        -_handle_validation_error(error_type, message, data)
        -_handle_validation_warning(warning_type, message, data)
    }
```

#### 3.2.2 Validation Types

The validation framework supports several types of validation:

1. **Basic OHLCV Validation**: Ensures that price and volume data meet fundamental quality requirements
   - Required fields validation
   - Type validation
   - Range validation
   - Consistency validation (high >= low, high >= open, high >= close, etc.)

2. **Quote Validation**: Ensures that bid/ask prices and sizes are consistent and reasonable
   - Required fields validation
   - Type validation
   - Range validation
   - Consistency validation (bid <= ask)
   - Warning for unusual values (zero prices, large spread)

3. **Trade Validation**: Ensures that trade prices and sizes are reasonable
   - Required fields validation
   - Type validation
   - Range validation
   - Warning for unusual values (high price, large size)

4. **Options Flow Validation**: Ensures that options data is consistent and reasonable
   - Required fields validation
   - Type validation
   - Value validation (option type)
   - Range validation
   - Date validation
   - Warning for unusual values (past expiration)

5. **Cross-Timeframe Consistency Validation**: Ensures that data is consistent across different timeframes
   - Resampling smaller timeframes to match larger timeframes
   - Comparing OHLCV values across timeframes
   - Validating consistency of derived features across timeframes

6. **Market Microstructure Validation**: Ensures that order book and trade flow data is consistent and reasonable
   - Order book imbalance validation
   - Trade flow imbalance validation
   - Price pressure validation
   - Extreme value detection

#### 3.2.3 Dynamic Validation Rules

The system adjusts validation thresholds based on volatility regimes and market hours:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Symbol] --> B{Volatility Regime?}
    B -->|Low| C[Tight Thresholds]
    B -->|Normal| D[Standard Thresholds]
    B -->|High| E[Relaxed Thresholds]
    
    F[Time] --> G{Market Hours?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Standard Thresholds]
    G -->|No| I[Relaxed Thresholds]
    
    C --> J[Final Thresholds]
    D --> J
    E --> J
    H --> J
    I --> J
```

#### 3.2.4 Batch Validation

The system supports batch validation for efficient processing of large datasets:

```python
def validate_batch_ohlcv(self, ohlcv_data: List[Tuple]) -> List[Tuple]:
    """Validate a batch of OHLCV data."""
    valid_data = []
    
    for data in ohlcv_data:
        if len(data) != 9:
            self._handle_validation_error("format_error", "OHLCV data tuple must have 9 elements", data)
            continue
            
        symbol, timestamp, open_price, high, low, close, volume, source, timeframe = data
        
        if self.validate_ohlcv(symbol, timestamp, open_price, high, low, close, volume, source, timeframe):
            valid_data.append(data)
    
    return valid_data
```

#### 3.2.5 Validation Statistics and Monitoring

The validation system tracks statistics and integrates with the monitoring system to provide alerts for validation failures:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Validation Results] --> B[Update Statistics]
    B --> C{Validation Status}
    C -->|Pass| D[Increment Passed Count]
    C -->|Fail| E[Increment Failed Count]
    C -->|Warning| F[Increment Warning Count]
    
    E --> G[Log Error]
    F --> H[Log Warning]
    
    G --> I[Update Error Counts by Type]
    
    D --> J[Validation Statistics]
    I --> J
    H --> J
    
    J --> K[Monitoring Dashboard]
    J --> L[Alerting System]
```

    DPS --> DTS
    DPS --> PS
    
    DV --> Mon
    Mon --> Alert
```

Key integration points:

1. **Feature Engineering Subsystem**: The Data Acquisition Subsystem provides validated data to the Feature Engineering Subsystem for calculating features
2. **Model Training Subsystem**: The validated data is used by the Model Training Subsystem for training machine learning models
3. **Trading Strategy Subsystem**: The Data Acquisition Subsystem interacts with the Dynamic Ticker Selector and Position Sizer components of the Trading Strategy Subsystem
4. **Monitoring Subsystem**: The Data Acquisition Subsystem reports validation statistics and errors to the Monitoring Subsystem for alerting and visualization

## 6. Error Handling and Resilience

The Data Acquisition Subsystem implements several error handling and resilience mechanisms:

1. **Job-Level Exception Handling**: Each job method has try-except blocks to catch and log exceptions
2. **Scheduler Loop Exception Handling**: The main scheduler loop has exception handling to prevent the scheduler from crashing
3. **Market Hours Check**: Jobs can be configured to only run during market hours
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: If dynamic ticker selection fails, the system falls back to default tickers
5. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of job execution status and errors
6. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Prevents repeated calls to failing endpoints
7. **Retry Mechanisms**: Implements exponential backoff for transient failures

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start Job] --> B{Market Open?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Execute Job]
    B -->|No| D{Force Execution?}
    D -->|Yes| C
    D -->|No| E[Skip Job]
    C --> F{Exception?}
    F -->|Yes| G[Log Error]
    F -->|No| H[Log Success]
    G --> I[Return Default/Empty Result]
    H --> J[Return Actual Result]
    I --> K[End Job]
    J --> K
    E --> K
```

## 7. Configuration Options

The Data Acquisition Subsystem supports several configuration options:

1. **Market Hours Only**: Only run jobs during market hours
2. **Symbols**: Comma-separated list of symbols to use (defaults to dynamic selection)
3. **Lookback Days**: Number of days to look back for historical data
4. **Strict Validation**: Enable strict validation mode
5. **Generate Report**: Generate validation report
6. **Max Active Tickers**: Maximum number of active tickers
7. **Focus Universe Size**: Number of tickers in the focus universe
8. **Min Volume**: Minimum trading volume for ticker selection
9. **Min Volatility**: Minimum volatility (ATR/price) for ticker selection
10. **Opportunity Threshold**: Minimum opportunity score for ticker selection

## 8. Performance Considerations

### 8.1 Batch Processing

For large datasets, use batch validation to improve performance:

```python
# Instead of validating individual data points
for data_point in data_points:
    validator.validate_ohlcv(...)

# Use batch validation
valid_data = validator.validate_batch_ohlcv(data_points)
```

### 8.2 Parallel Validation

For very large datasets, consider parallel validation:

```python
def validate_in_parallel(data_chunks):
    with concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
        results = list(executor.map(validator.validate_batch_ohlcv, data_chunks))
    return [item for sublist in results for item in sublist]
```

### 8.3 Caching Volatility Regimes

Cache volatility regimes to avoid recalculating them for each validation:

```python
# Calculate volatility regimes once
for symbol in symbols:
    volatility = calculate_volatility(symbol)
    validator.set_volatility_regime(symbol, get_regime(volatility))

# Use cached regimes in validation
validator.validate_price_change(symbol, prev_price, curr_price)
```

## 9. Best Practices

1. **Use strict mode in production** - Enable strict validation mode in production to ensure data quality
2. **Monitor validation statistics** - Regularly review validation statistics to identify potential issues
3. **Adjust thresholds as needed** - Fine-tune validation thresholds based on your specific requirements
4. **Validate across timeframes** - Always validate data across multiple timeframes for consistency
5. **Validate market microstructure** - Pay special attention to market microstructure validation for trading strategies
6. **Set appropriate volatility regimes** - Adjust validation thresholds based on market volatility
7. **Handle validation warnings** - Review validation warnings to identify potential issues before they become errors
8. **Use batch validation for efficiency** - Use batch validation for large datasets to improve performance
9. **Integrate with monitoring** - Integrate validation statistics with your monitoring system for real-time alerting
10. **Regularly review validation rules** - Periodically review and update validation rules based on changing market conditions
