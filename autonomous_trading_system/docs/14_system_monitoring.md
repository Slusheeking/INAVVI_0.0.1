# System Monitoring

## 1. Introduction

The System Monitoring component is a critical part of the Autonomous Trading System responsible for ensuring the system's health, performance, and reliability. It provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities across all subsystems, enabling real-time visibility into the system's operation and facilitating quick detection and resolution of issues.

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the System Monitoring component, including its architecture, implementation, and integration with other subsystems.

## 2. System Architecture Overview

The System Monitoring component follows a modular architecture with several key components:

## 3. Metrics Collection

### 3.1 System Metrics

System metrics provide insights into the health and performance of the underlying infrastructure:

- **CPU Usage**: Monitors CPU utilization across all nodes
- **Memory Usage**: Tracks memory consumption and potential memory leaks
- **Disk I/O**: Monitors disk read/write operations and latency
- **Network I/O**: Tracks network traffic, bandwidth usage, and latency
- **GPU Utilization**: Monitors GPU usage for model training and inference

Example Prometheus configuration for system metrics:

```yaml
# prometheus.yml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'node_exporter'
    scrape_interval: 15s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['node-exporter:9100']
  - job_name: 'gpu_metrics'
    scrape_interval: 15s
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['gpu-exporter:9400']
```

### 3.2 Application Metrics

Application metrics provide insights into the behavior and performance of the trading system components:

- **Request Rate**: Tracks the number of requests processed by each component
- **Response Time**: Monitors the latency of each component
- **Error Rate**: Tracks the number of errors encountered by each component
- **Queue Length**: Monitors the length of processing queues
- **Component Health**: Tracks the health status of each component

Example application metrics collection using Prometheus client library:

```python
# metrics.py
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, Gauge, Summary

# Request counter
REQUEST_COUNT = Counter(
    'request_total',
    'Total number of requests',
    ['component', 'endpoint', 'method', 'status']
)

# Response time histogram
RESPONSE_TIME = Histogram(
    'response_time_seconds',
    'Response time in seconds',
    ['component', 'endpoint', 'method'],
    buckets=[0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10]
)

# Queue length gauge
QUEUE_LENGTH = Gauge(
    'queue_length',
    'Number of items in the queue',
    ['component', 'queue_name']
)

# Component health gauge
COMPONENT_HEALTH = Gauge(
    'component_health',
    'Health status of the component (1 = healthy, 0 = unhealthy)',
    ['component']
)
```

### 3.3 Business Metrics

Business metrics provide insights into the trading performance and business outcomes:

- **Trade Count**: Tracks the number of trades executed
- **Trade Volume**: Monitors the volume of trades
- **Profit/Loss**: Tracks the profit or loss from trades
- **Position Size**: Monitors the size of positions
- **Model Accuracy**: Tracks the accuracy of prediction models
- **Strategy Performance**: Monitors the performance of trading strategies

Example business metrics collection:

```python
# business_metrics.py
from prometheus_client import Counter, Gauge, Summary

# Trade counter
TRADE_COUNT = Counter(
    'trade_total',
    'Total number of trades',
    ['ticker', 'strategy', 'direction']
)

# Trade volume
TRADE_VOLUME = Counter(
    'trade_volume_total',
    'Total volume of trades',
    ['ticker', 'strategy', 'direction']
)

# Profit/loss
PROFIT_LOSS = Counter(
    'profit_loss_total',
    'Total profit or loss',
    ['ticker', 'strategy']
)

# Position size
POSITION_SIZE = Gauge(
    'position_size',
    'Current position size',
    ['ticker', 'strategy']
)

# Model accuracy
MODEL_ACCURACY = Gauge(
    'model_accuracy',
    'Model prediction accuracy',
    ['model', 'timeframe']
)

# Strategy performance
STRATEGY_PERFORMANCE = Gauge(
    'strategy_performance',
    'Strategy performance metrics',
    ['strategy', 'metric']
)
```

## 4. Logging

### 4.1 Log Collection

The system uses a structured logging approach to collect logs from all components:

```python
# logger.py
import logging
import json
from datetime import datetime

class StructuredLogger:
    def __init__(self, component_name):
        self.component_name = component_name
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(component_name)
        self.logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
        
        # Add console handler
        console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
        console_handler.setFormatter(logging.Formatter('%(message)s'))
        self.logger.addHandler(console_handler)
    
    def log(self, level, message, **kwargs):
        """Log a structured message"""
        log_data = {
            'timestamp': datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            'component': self.component_name,
            'level': level,
            'message': message
        }
        log_data.update(kwargs)
        
        log_message = json.dumps(log_data)
        
        if level == 'DEBUG':
            self.logger.debug(log_message)
        elif level == 'INFO':
            self.logger.info(log_message)
        elif level == 'WARNING':
            self.logger.warning(log_message)
        elif level == 'ERROR':
            self.logger.error(log_message)
        elif level == 'CRITICAL':
            self.logger.critical(log_message)
    
    def debug(self, message, **kwargs):
        self.log('DEBUG', message, **kwargs)
    
    def info(self, message, **kwargs):
        self.log('INFO', message, **kwargs)
    
    def warning(self, message, **kwargs):
        self.log('WARNING', message, **kwargs)
    
    def error(self, message, **kwargs):
        self.log('ERROR', message, **kwargs)
    
    def critical(self, message, **kwargs):
        self.log('CRITICAL', message, **kwargs)
```

### 4.2 Log Processing

Logs are processed using Fluentd to parse, filter, and enrich log data:

```
# fluentd.conf
<source>
  @type forward
  port 24224
  bind 0.0.0.0
</source>

<filter **>
  @type parser
  key_name log
  reserve_data true
  <parse>
    @type json
  </parse>
</filter>

<match **>
  @type elasticsearch
  host elasticsearch
  port 9200
  logstash_format true
  logstash_prefix fluentd
  include_tag_key true
  type_name access_log
  tag_key @log_name
  flush_interval 1s
</match>
```

### 4.3 Log Storage

Logs are stored in Elasticsearch for efficient querying and analysis:

```yaml
# elasticsearch.yml
cluster.name: "trading-system-logs"
network.host: 0.0.0.0
discovery.type: single-node
```

## 5. Alerting

### 5.1 Alert Rules

Alert rules define conditions that trigger alerts:

      description: "Model accuracy is below 50% for 30 minutes for {{ $labels.model }}"
```

### 5.2 Alert Notifications

Alerts are sent to various notification channels:

```yaml
# alertmanager.yml

  group_wait: 30s
  group_interval: 5m
  repeat_interval: 4h
  receiver: 'slack-notifications'
  routes:
  - match:
      severity: critical
    receiver: 'pagerduty-critical'
    continue: true

receivers:

  slack_configs:
  - channel: '#alerts'
    send_resolved: true
    title: '{{ .GroupLabels.alertname }}'
    text: '{{ range .Alerts }}{{ .Annotations.description }}{{ end }}'

    ]
  }
}
```
